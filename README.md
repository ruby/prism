This is a parser for the Ruby programming language. It is designed to be portable, error tolerant, and maintainable. It is written in C99 and has no dependencies. It is currently being integrated into [CRuby](https://github.com/ruby/ruby), [JRuby](https://github.com/jruby/jruby), [TruffleRuby](https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby), [Sorbet](https://github.com/sorbet/sorbet), and [Syntax Tree](https://github.com/ruby-syntax-tree/syntax_tree).

## Overview

The repository contains the infrastructure for both a shared library (libprism) and a native CRuby extension. The shared library has no bindings to CRuby itself, and so can be used by other projects. The native CRuby extension links against `ruby.h`, and so is suitable in the context of CRuby.

## Getting started

To compile the shared library, you will need:

* A C99 compiler
* autotools (autoconf, automake, libtool)
* make
* Ruby 3.3.0-preview1 or later

Once you have these dependencies, run:

```
bundle install
```

to fetch the Ruby dependencies. Finally, run:

```
bundle exec rake compile
```

to compile the shared library. It will be built in the `build` directory. To test that everything is working, run:

```
bin/parse -e "1 + 2"
```

to see the syntax tree for the expression `1 + 2`.
