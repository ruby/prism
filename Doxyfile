# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.

# All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed in
# front of the TAG it is preceding.
#
# All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
# The format is:
# TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists, items can also be appended using:
# TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (\" \").

#
# Use doxygen to compare the used configuration file with the template
# configuration file:
# doxygen -x [configFile]
